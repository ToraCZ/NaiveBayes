NaiveBayes
==========

A simple implementation of Gaussian Naive Bayes in Java



This java program is capable of classifying using Naive bays and testing the accuracy.

To run the program, train.txt and test.txt should be present in the same folder location as the source code.



The class probabilities are printed as a mx1 matrix 

The conditional mean and conditional variance matrices are having classes as rows and features as columns

The predictions are appended as a last column to the test data after classification
